            <p>Leadership is a process by which a leader influences individuals to accomplish common goals or objectives. However, the foundation of a great leader is managing and leading oneself before leading others. A leader sets direction through providing a vision, mission, SMART objects and strategies to make the dream come true. Besides, a leader communicates and persuades his followers to understand and accept the vision and to work to realize it enthusiastically. <mark>Great leader motivates the followers and move them because he/she ignites their passion and inspire the best in them.</mark></p>
